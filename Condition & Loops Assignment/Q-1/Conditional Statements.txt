Q1. What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.
===

Conditional statements are essential programming constructs that dictate how our code behaves under different circumstances. 
They allow us to execute blocks of code only if specific conditions are met. 

Types of Conditional Statements : 

1. if Statements : Use an if statement when we want a block of code to execute only if a condition is true. 
            Syntax: 
                        if (condition) {
                        // code to be executed if condition is true
        }

            Example:    let age = 25;
                        if (age >= 18) {
                        console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
        }


2. else Statements : Used in conjunction with if to provide an alternative block of code to execute if the if condition is false.

            Syntax: 
                        if (condition) {
                            // code to be executed if condition is true
                        } else {
                            // code to be executed if condition is false
                }

            Example:
                        JavaScript
                        let score = 45;
                        if (score >= 50) {
                            console.log("You passed the exam!");
                        } else {
                            console.log("Unfortunately, you did not pass.");
                        } 

3. else if Statements : Offer multiple conditions to check, providing greater flexibility in decision-making.

            Syntax:
                        if (condition1) {
                            // code to be executed if condition1 is true
                        } else if (condition2) {
                            // code to be executed if condition2 is true
                        } else {
                            // code to be executed if none of the above conditions are true
                        }

            Example:

                        let grade = 82; 
                        if (grade >= 90) {
                                console.log("You got an A!");
                            } else if (grade >= 80) {
                                console.log("You got a B!");
                            } else if (grade >= 70) {
                                console.log("You got a C.");
                            } else {
                                console.log("You did not pass.");
                         }
