Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and examples.

    What are Loops?
Loops are fundamental programming constructs that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. 
They streamline your code by saving you from writing the same instructions repeatedly, making your programs more efficient and easier to manage.


    Need Loops :
Automation of Repetitive Tasks
Iterating Over Collections
Conditional Execution

    Types of Loops : 
1.For Loops : The loop runs as long as this condition evaluates to true.
        Syntax : for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
                            // code to be executed repeatedly
                        } 
        Example: for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                        console.log("Iteration number: " + i);
                    }


2. while loop : The loop keeps running as long as the condition remains true.  It's essential to ensure the condition will eventually become false to avoid an infinite loo
        Syntax : while (condition) {
                // code to be executed repeatedly
                }
        Example : let count = 0;
                    while (count < 10) {
                    console.log("Count is: " + count);
                    count++;
                }
                

3. do...while loop : his loop is similar to the while loop, but the difference is that the code block is guaranteed to execute at least once before the condition is checked.
        Syntax : do {
                // code to be executed repeatedly
                } while (condition);
        Example:    let i = 0;
                    do {
                        console.log("Number: " + i);
                        i++;
                    } while (i < 5);

                    
4. for...in loop : Primarily used to iterate over the properties of an object. The variable key holds the name of the property in each iteration.
        Syntax : for (key in object) {
                // code to be executed for each property
                 }
        Example: onst person = { name: "Alice", age: 30, city: "New York" };
                for (const prop in person) {
                    console.log(prop + ": " + person[prop]); 
                }


5. for...of loop : Designed to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, and more. The variable value holds the current element from the iterable object in each iteration.
        Syntax : for (value of iterable) {
                    // code to be executed for each element
                }
        Example : const numbers = [1, 5, 3, 8];
                for (const num of numbers) {
                    console.log(num);
                }
